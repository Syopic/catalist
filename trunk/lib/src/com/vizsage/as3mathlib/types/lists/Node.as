/**
 * @class       com.vizsage.as3mathlib.types.lists.Node
 * @author      Richard Wright
 * @version     1.6
 * @description Implements the behaviours of the Node Class.
 *              <p>
 *		        BinaryTree.as is built using this node class. Each node stores one
 *              data element, and has left and right sub-tree pointer which may be
 *              null. The node is a 'dumb' nested class -- we just use it for
 *              storage; it does not have any methods.
 * @usage       <pre>var inst:Node = new Node(newData)</pre>
 * @param       newData (Number)  -- a real number.
